In the east wall is a chromium-plated turnstile. 21You're in the tube station.                                                                       23You are on the platform of an underground stationall around is grime and squalor and as you walk, 23your feet disturb rats which are feeding in the  scraps of half-eaten food, littering the ground. 23The graffiti-scrawled notices on the wall say    "London Transport : Bakerloo Line".  In the west 21wall is a doorway with a turnstile.                                                               22The inspector bars your way with a grubby hand.  "May I see your ticket, sir?"                    22"Don't try that rough stuff on me, sunny Jim.    I was in the war, you know!!".                   21"Brought your lunch, have you, sir?"                                                              22"Sorry sir, but it's more than my job's          worth....."                                      22Standing in his immaculately filthy uniform, idlypicking his nose with a ticket punch, is a       21ticket inspector.                                                                                 20493056210563            PILEDROPE                               E            30 21  0769 220336   41Just by your foot is a                                                                            21pile of dragon droppings.                                                                         20544055910560            INSP    31410557K4810556F4810782E       E              905   0780120567  15054503941                        C0120398C0220392C0320566E                                       E 30548054711651            * KR1654C0320567C0420565C0221664E                                       E 3055105501    0688    0687* KR2916C044056810110779C1040568E                                       E 320569105551099    310                                                TICKET BARRIER                692110205660000    5                                                  TAKE TICKET                   63Sie befinden sich nun am noerdlichen Badestrand  im deutschsprachigen Viertel der Hoehle.

The ensuing explosion   22is loud and violent and you didn't really stand  a chance.                                        23As the wand hits the wall, there is a loud reportand the whole scene is engulfed in acrid pink    22smoke.  When it subsides, a flaming torch has    mysteriously materialised in your hand.          23The wand skates across the floor showering sparksas it does so.  As it hits the wall, there is a  22loud bang and a lightweight rubber boat magicallyappears amongst your baggage.                    234112     057903443            12                                                                  63410300000057703443            03                                                                  63There is a loud rushing noise in your ears and anicy wind blows in your face and sets your senses 22reeling.

There is a small      23notice on the door which reads:%1                  "The caverns beyond this door are particularly 23perilous.

A    path continues southwards, and there is a small  21cave to the west.                                                                                 22The hinges on the old door are rusted solid, it  will not budge an inch.                          21The door is not locked.                                                                           220622106050000    2                                                                                61The great door clangs shut.                                                                       22Some glittering emeralds have just appeared      in your hand.                                    22short stout stick with a white handkerchief tied onto one end.                                    23You are in a small featureless chamber.

There are doors tothe east and west and a rope bridge stretching   21over a deep crevasse to the south.                                                                23As you have no lamp, you stumbled on the         threshold in the dark and cracked your head on   21the solid rock floor.                                                                             2606204065600000634300          031928                                EXPERT CAV.

Thevibrations get worse and worse until finally the 23worn old ropes can stand it no longer.

All around you in the dim light,          23unblinking pairs of pink eyes can be seen peepingat you through the tree roots.  Arboron burrows  21lead off to the west and south.                                                                   21You are in the land of the Arborons.                                                              23You are now in the Arboron grave yard.  Arboron  corpses in various states of decay are arranged  23in neat rows against the north wall and the      stench is appalling.  Welcome gusts of fresh air 22can be felt from south and west, whilst an       Arboron burrow leads off to the east.            21You are in the Arboron grave yard.                                                                22The little cobbled path along which you are      walking turns southwards here.                   22On the corner is a small brick building with the name plate "Bert the elf" on the sturdy oak door.21You are outside the house of Bert the elf.                                                        22The little cobbled path along which you are      walking turns eastwards here.                    23The door is opened by Bert, wearing a fine red   cap and olive green suit.  Traditional elf       21hospitality being what it is, he invites you in.                                                  23You are now in old Bert's house.  The shelves arelined with all manner of strange artifacts       23gathered during old Bert's 357 years of life.      "I shall show you some of my more prized       22possesions later if you like" says old Bert "willyou stay to tea ?"                               23You realise of course that to refuse an          invitation to tea is about the biggest social    22snub you can perpetrate in elvish etiquette.       Bert is rightly upset and shows you the door.  23Tea is (as always in an elvish household)        magnificent.  The traditional 27 different       23courses are all served with the necessary pomp   and ceremony. The dishes range from the piquant  23pickled subterranian mushrooms in oak root sauce to the rare and succulent delicacy of boiled     23arboron ears in jelly.                             After tea (which lasts some five hours) Bert   23takes you through into his back room museum in   which his favourite treasures are housed.        23  After browsing for a pleasant half hour among  such rare exhibits as a complete set of coinage  23from the reign of elf king Zorgat the large, and an autographed copy of the complete works of     23Cedric Dewdrop, Bert wishes you a fond farewell  with a parting gift of a beautiful silver oil    22lamp with hand painted scenes of the orient on   it.                                              21You are in Bert's house, will you stay for tea ?                                                  21silver oil lamp with scenes of the orient on it.                                                  21You are in the tiny cave again.                                                                   21Orange cherry pear   -   you lose.%1                                                              21Pear pear banana     -   you lose.%1                                                              21Banana cherry cherry   -   you lose.%1                                                            21Pear orange pear    -   you lose.%1                                                               21Orange orange orange   -   you win !%1                                                            23You are at the cross roads.

The roof of the cave is made of glass, and through it the 21sun's rays shine down on the lush green grass.                                                    21You are in the meadow.                                                                            23You are at the national elvish dog show.  All    around, all breeds both the familiar and the     23strangely novel are being put through their pacesand judged by elderly and distinguished looking  23elves.

Aroundthe walls are flashing lights and huge coloured  23displays of orbital paths. Your attention is     transfixed by the sleek form of a rocket, poised 23on a ramp at the top of a flight of steel stairs.Faint wisps of vapour are drifting from the side 23of the craft, and from all around you comes the  faint hum of enormous forces waiting to be       21unleashed.                                                                                        23The motors ignite with a shattering roar, fillingthe silo with white hot gas. At least you didn't 21have time to feel much!!!! %0                                                                     23The rocket smashes into the great steel doors in the roof of the silo. As the retaining straps of 23your seat break under the stress of more than 200'g', you reflect how lucky you are to have       21avoided the resulting explosion.                                                                  23You are in a small control room, adjoining the   main silo.                                       23On the panel before you are a number of          interesting lights and buttons. One is labelled  21'UPWISE EGRESS CON'                                                                               23The great steel doors in the silo roof rumble    open, revealing a smooth vertical tube, at the   21top of which you can see the sky.                                                                 23You are strapped in the reclining seat of the    command module of a rocket. Most of the screens  22in front of you are blank, but there is a panel  reading 'launch circuits armed'.                 21You're in a store room.                                                                           21Hanging from a rack in front of you is a                                                          21double-breasted pinstripe spacesuit.                                                              23The great engines ignite, and the rocket surges  upwards, the acceleration pressing you hard into 22your seat. I hope you remembered to remove your  small change from your back pocket!              23As your senses slowly recover, after the spell inhigh 'g', you notice that the rocket is in orbit 22round the moon. You also notice that there is a  hatch above you, reading 'lunar landing module'. 21You're in the landing module.                                                                     21You are sitting in the lunar landing module.                                                      21You're in the control module.                                                                     23In response to your command, the landing module  separates from the main body of the rocket and,  23under computer guidance, spirals in towards the  moon. There is a lurch as the retro rockets fire 21and when the dust settles, you can see that                                                       23You are on the moon's surface. Through the ports,the land is harsh and barren. The sky is pitch   22black, but the glare from the rocks makes it     impossible for you to see the stars.             23I regret to inform you that you have just        exploded! may I suggest that you don't try it    21again, since it may be damaging to your health.                                                   21The earth has just disappeared!!!!!! %0                                                           23Look, there doesn't seem to be much point in     prolonging this, actually. Let's just say that   23your air ran out. Reincarnation may take a bit   longer this time, since there's all those other  21poor beggars to reconstitute as well.                                                             21You're standing on the moon.                                                                      22You are standing on the surface of the moon.     All is silence, desolation and grey rock.        22A selenite just stuck his head above a rock and  looked at you !                                  22A selenite sneaked up behind you while you were  admiring the view, and pulled off your air line! 21Within easy reach is a                                                                            21chunk of lunar rock.                                                                              22Mission control recommend that you do not        deviate from the landing area.                   22There was only enough fuel for one landing. You  crashed somewhere in the mare crisium!!          23With a cloud of dust, and a burst of static in   your helmet, the lunar module takes off. The     22surface of the moon drops away like a stone      down a well.                                     23You are now in orbit round the moon. A few metresahead of you drifts the angular shape of the     21command module.                                                                                   23You managed to escape the feeble pull of the     moon's gravity,but lacked the fuel to do anything22else. How does it feel to make the world's first solar landing!!                                  22You have successfully docked with the command    module. The hatch below you has now opened.      23You are back in the command module. Through the  windows, you can see the harsh face of the moon, 23far below. The hatch above you is now closed,    and a sign on the control panel reads            21'lunar module jettisoned'.                                                                        23The main engines fire, blasting you out of lunar orbit and back towards earth. You re-enter on a  23column of flame, and as you drop through the     clouds, you can see a road far below. The chutes 22open, and you are lowered gently to the ground.

An icy wind is blowing along  23the street from the south, sending the odd ball  of tumbleweed hurtling past.  Above the high     23pitched shriek of the wind, the sound of piano   music can be heard from the saloon to the west.  22On the building on the east side of the street   the sign "sherrif" hangs at a slight angle.      21You are in the western street.                                                                    22The stairs are too dark to negotiate without a   light of some description.                       22The stairs eventually emerge into a dimly lit    room.                                            23You are in a small office.  The door to the west is rattling in what must be a very fierce wind   23outside, whilst to the east are some cells.  On  the north wall next to the stairs is a neat row  23of eight winchester repeater rifles held in placeby a stout oak retaining bar and a large padlock,23whilst on a bench in the corner there are two    saddles.  On the other side of the room, an aging23elf wearing a cowboy hat and spurs is sleeping   soundly with his feet up on a small wooden one-  21drawer desk.                                                                                      23The drawer is shorter than it looks.  As you     open it, it falls right out depositing its       21contents  (the sherrif's gun) onto the floor.                                                     21gun.                                                                                              21You are in the saloon.                                                                            21You are in the office.                                                                            21112223920        3            031928                                DOWN STAIRS                   6114111441                        C0321139C0621137C0521140E                                       E 32113821138112311233                                                  ENTER OFF.                    6112411341    0000        * KR1516C0121136C0521136C0321199C0421148C1021148E                       E 3114511451                        C0421136C1021136E                                               E 31112220893        3            031928                                UP STEPS                      63You are on a dimly lit flight of stone steps.

However I shall try to guess which way    you would like to go.                            22121721217120612063                                                                                6120812081                        C0121245C0221219C0321220C0421218E                               E 32121721222        3                             5                                                  62121721231        3                             4                                                  62121721226        3                             5                                                  62122221222120612063                                                                                6120812081                        C0121238C0221223C0321218C0421232E                               E 32122221231        3                             4                                                  6121112111    1240                C0141333C0211213C0311213C041121313221243E                       E 32122621231        3                             4                                                  6120812081                        C0121229C0221225C0321234C0421220E                               E 32122621226120612063                                                                                61016921222        3                             5                                                  62009121226        3                             5                                                  62123321231        3                             4                                                  62122461210        3                             3                                                  62122221233        3                             5                                                  6120812081                        C0121236C0221230C0321232C0421234E                               E 32122621233        3                             5                                                  62123321233120612063                                                                                62123322332    23183                             4                                                  62123821239121412143                             5                                                  62121721226        3                             5                                                  62123321222        3                             5                                                  61There is a union jack stuck in the ground nearby.                                                 2300005050P1067    5                                                                                69113221241        5                                                                                62124211244        1                                                                                61I'm sorry, but someone beat you to it.                                                            22121721148        3                             4                                                  61You are now out on the open range.                                                                2124612461                        C0121272C0221148C0321761C0421755E                               E 31You have arrived at the foot of a tall cliff.                                                     23It looks as if there is a small cave entrance    just in front of you (to the north), but it is   21blocked by an enormous rock.                                                                      21You cannot squeeze past the enormous rock.                                                        23An aperture just large enough for a man is       visible behind an enormous rock near the cliff   21face to your north.                                                                               22The great rock rolls back to reveal a narrow     aperture just wide enough for a man.             23As you wave your rod, you get a strange          premonition - what you really need is a magic    21lamp.                                                                                             23P o p !!!   the genie appears.

The air is fresh and clean23and everywhere you look are flags, fluttering    bravely in the breeze.  In the distance, a dragon23circles in a thermal; although you can't be sure at such a distance, there may be someone on his  23back. Below you, the city stretches, its gilded  spires and minarettes catching the last rays of  23the setting sun. A faint scent of jasmine drifts on the evening breeze, mingled with the rich     21smells of spices and incense.......                                                               21You're on the steps of the railway station.                                                       23You are on the steps of the railway station,     looking down on the market place of a great city.23Before you are spotless white buildings, tipped  with minarettes and corbels of pure gold, and    23elaborately bedecked with flags bearing the      crests of the great Paranomasiac families.  The  23sun is setting, and all around you, the stall    keepers are lighting their lanterns, forming     23glimmering pools of flickering light among the   throng. Nobody stares at you, as you stand,      23streaked with mud from the caves and festooned   with impedimenta: travellers are frequent and    21welcome in Paranomasia.........                                                                   21You're back at the stall of Marcus Spencius.                                                      23You are standing by the stall of Marcus Spencius,the merchant.

A damsel with a dulcimeris sitting outside, and the rippling music that  23she conjures brings thrills to your very soul.   The last rays of the setting sun turn the pillars21around the entrance into burnished flame.                                                         23A heavily armed steward bars your way "I regret,"he says, "that you cannot enter here". "Unless,  22of course, you are a member, and familiar with   the password......                               23An obsequious flunkey materialises out of the    woodwork : "since master is familiar with the    22password, I shall convey him to the realms of    pleasure. Please follow me.......                22The steward nods approvingly and ushers you      through the portals into the pleasure dome.....  21You're back in the travel office.                                                                 23You are in a small, but luxuriously furnished    office. A bearded man is sitting behind a desk,  23reading a copy of 'Gnomes and Gardens' and       looking rather bored. As you enter, he sighs and 23stands up. "If you want to get back to the caves,you can use my matter transporter, its just      22through that door to the south, but I hope you'vehad a good look round before you go."            22123761210        3                             2                                                  63An idler in the crowd spots the statue of Gardol,and with a cry of "death to the tyrant and all   21his toadies!!!" garrottes you with his tie!!!! %0                                                 22The button pulls away from the panel in a shower of sparks, electrocuting you in the process!!! %021You're back in the store room.                                                                    21You have arrived in a store room.                                                                 23Littering the floor are jars of priceless oils   and unguents.                                    23Lurking in the corner, its vacant eye sockets    glaring at you for entering the domain of the    22undead, is the repulsive festering form of a     zombie!!!!!!                                     22A beautiful naked girl is standing submissively  before you.                                      21The zombie shuffles towards you, moaning         horribly.                                        22The zombie attempts to wrap its arms around you  but you brush it aside with a shudder.....       22The zombie stretches clammy hands towards your   face; you back away in disgust.........          23With a soul-wrenching cry, the zombie collapses  to the ground. Before your unbelieving eyes, it  23is briefly transformed into the naked body of a  beautiful young girl, before dissolving into a   23pile of ashes. All around you, the jars of oil   are dissolving too, until you are left alone,    21in a silent, empty room..........                                                                 23The alembic shatters on the floor before the     zombie, who crumples and falls to the ground,    23enveloped in green smoke. The smoke clears slowlyand there, on the floor, is the naked body of a  23beautiful young girl. She stands up gracefully   and turns towards you..... Out of the corner of  23your eye, you notice that the rest of the room isnow empty, save for a pile of silk cushions on   21floor............                                                                                 21The zombie is in the way!!!                                                                       22The elevator plummets downwards. When it glides  to a stop, you find that                         22The elevator climbs steadily. When it glides to  a halt, you find to your delight that            22The girl runs her hands sensuously through your  hair and kisses you passionately................ 22She beckons you towards the cushions on the floorwith an unmistakeable gleam in her eyes......... 22You sink down together on the silk cushions,     locked in a passionate embrace...................22Your eyes close as you thrill to her perfume, andwhen you open them                               22Hanging from a skyhook before you is a battered  but serviceable looking                          21silken parachute.                                                                                 21278136211363            PARACHUTE                               E                        370021   43You are in a stainless steel box in the roof of  of the log cabin.

To the   north is the open sea, whilst to the east is     23an old inn called "The Jolly Sailor".  Moored at the quayside is a four masted square rigger      21"The Silver Fore" with its gang plank down.                                                       21You are at the quayside again.                                                                    23You are in the bar of the Jolly Sailor.  At old  oak tables, the other customers, most of them    23wearing striped jerseys and bell bottom trousers,are sitting laughing and joking over mugs of ale 23served by a buxom serving wench who seems to be  experiencing some difficulty remaining inside    21her low fronted dress.                                                                            21You are in the bar of the Jolly Sailor.                                                           23You are on the main deck of the square rigger    "The Silver Fore".  A few feet away is a door    23marked "captains cabin" whilst just beside you   are some wooden steps leading down to the crew's 21quarters.                                                                                         21You are on deck of "The Silver Fore".                                                             22The ship has set sail, because nothing but sea   is visible in all directions.                    22As you step out onto the deck, you trip over a   discarded belaying pin.  When you come round     22The ship is at anchor, and the gang plank has    been lowered.                                    23Suddenly there is a great deal of commotion, withsailors running everywhere.  You seem to have    23arrived at your destination, because cries of    "drop anchor", "lower the mainsail" and "bags I  22The first woman we find ashore" can be discerned above the general noise.                         23You are in the captain's cabin.  In one corner isan ornated wooden desk with a neatly folded chart23on it, whilst all around the walls are paintings of men o' war engaged in heroic conflicts, and   22a number of portraits of distinguished looking   naval officers.                                  21You are in the captain's cabin.                                                                   23You are now down in the crew's quarters where a  number of sailors (particularly the younger ones)23are looking a bit the worse for the combination  of a choppy sea on top of a generous grog ration.21  The atmosphere is a little less than pleasant.                                                  21You are in the crew's quarters.                                                                   2TARD?   21930SOX ?   20001ROD ?   34101SWOR?   34119HERR?   34114DINO?   23186DOME?   219513091    7152715301                * KR1599C0321556C0221391C0111594C0421440$WA23257C0921556E               3 3153115351                * KR1671C0421555C1021555E                                               E 32155821558154115413                                                  BOARD SHIP                    615361539115401542    1543* KR1560C0621559$WA23257C0911191C1021621E                               E 3155015531                        C0521558C1021558E                                               E 3OPENDOOR11191FORC?   11427PICKLOCK11427KICKDOOR11426UNLODOOR21562?

On the stage, a counter-tenor,    23wearing a spangled costume, is singing the       schoenberg piece 'Pierrot Lunaire'. The sounds he23is making remind you of a fingernail scraping    down a blackboard, but the rest of the clientele 21seem to be enjoying it.                                                                           22A good idea, but I don't think the audience will let you.                                         22The audience glare at you, and motion you to be  quiet.                                           23An usher appears, grabs your arm in a vice-like  grip, and discreetly but firmly 'helps' you to   21the exit!!!                                                                                       22Please don't do that, sir; you're disturbing the other customers.                                 23The room you are in resembles a cheap dance hall there is a mirror ball hanging from the roof,    23reflecting spots of light around the room, and   in its dim light, you can see some low tables,   23each occupied with a bored-looking hostess. In   front of a large sign reading 'beware of pick-   23pockets' are the band, all stoned out of their   minds, and playing very cool, very slow dance    21music.                                                                                            22"You'd like to buy a drink for me, sugar? gee    thanks!!

Little fish dart back and forth here and there   23and the sunshine glints and twinkles as it       dances over the water's surface.                 22  The warm sunshine is pleasantly soporific, and the grass is soft, lush and green.               21You are on the east bank of the babbling brook.                                                   23Unfortunately the cute little fish darting back  and forth under the surface are in actual fact   23pirhanas.

Nice to know that you weren't defeatedby being de-feeted !  A stabbing pain is felt in 23the stumps of your legs as they slowly elongate  into two brand new and perfectly formed legs.    22Even your trousers are restored. (After all we   don't want to get arrested now do we ?)          23The dizzy warmth of the summer's afternoon closesin on you and the smell of the grass makes your  21senses reel as you drift off into a deep sleep.                                                   22You awake very much refreshed and ready to face  anything that fate has to throw at you.          23Suddenly your slumbers are disturbed by a figure rushing noisily past.  Through your blinking eyes23you can just make out the figure of a white      rabbit as he pauses to consult his pocket watch. 22 "Oh I'm late" he says, "I'm most terribly late."Before scurrying off.                            23The chase takes you breathlessly over several    hedges and small brooks then finally into a large23grassy field.  You arrive just in time to see therabbit, now only a few yards ahead, vanish down a21rabbit hole.                                                                                      22249225310363036222652263* KR2275C0122325C0222326C0422274C0322344E                                 3300005000Q        1                              FALL ASLEEP - NO CHARGE FOR MOVE IF ALREADY ASLEEP6225422541                * KR2276C0112258C0212258C0312258C041225810122329E                         3SLEE?   22273GO  SLEE22273?

Maybe, onthe other hand, cats eat bats. Before you have   23time to work it all out however, your thoughts   are rudely interrupted as you land in a heap on  21the floor (I've no idea who left it there).                                                       23Suddenly your fall is checked as you land in a   heap on the floor (I've no idea who left it      21there).                                                                                           22The grass is getting sparser now, and a cold windis getting up.                                   21Sorry - sleep walking is too dangerous.                                                           22This is no time to be worrying about what you arecarrying - you've got no legs!                   23If you really want the custodian to step in and  help you, type the magic words "prog zarp" and he23will restore your legs (at a price).  With       suitable magic though, you might be able to get  21them back for free.                                                                               23With an enormous bang, your legs are restored to their former glory.  You have been penalised     22though for coming cap in hand to the custodians  for help.                                        23As you proceed north, you begin to become more   enclosed.  Two large cliffs have risen up to east22and west and seem to be getting closer the       further you go.                                  23You are in a narrow valley running from north to south.  Two high and sheer cliff walls enclose   22you to the east and west, and the sound of your  footsteps echoes eerily between the two cliffs.  23After a short distance, the cliffs move closer   still until you can actually touch both walls    22simultaneously with your hands.  A few yards     further and the two cliffs actually join.        23You are standing in the "v" shape formed by two  enormous cliffs.  There is a small aperture to   22the north where they join, but it is scarcely    big enough to admit a human hand.                23The light from the sky is suddenly extinguished. Several pink and green flashes are visible but   23they seem as if they could be coming from inside your own head.  An incredible feeling of vertigo 23and nausea overtakes you as you become completelydisoriented and collapse onto the ground.        23  Minutes if not hours pass before your senses   finally return.  When you pick yourself up and   23look around, you are in complete darkness except for a small chink of light to the south.  On     23looking through this aperture you can see open   air the other side of it.  Your wand lies the    22other side of the crack, tantalisingly out of    reach.                                           23As you move southwards, the cliffs recede into   the distance, and a small brook approaches from  21your right hand side.                                                                             21You are at the joining of the cliff walls.                                                        22You are on a cold and windy plain.  Grass is     growing here and there, but only in small clumps.23As you proceed southwards, it starts to snow.    There is no grass underfoot anymore, and the wind21is getting worse.                                                                                 23As you proceed northwards, the wind starts to    drop a little.  It has stopped snowing and there 21is even the odd clump of grass underfoot.                                                         22You are in a large field with a hedge all around it, and a rabbit hole in one corner.             22You are in a small square room with a door in    each wall.                                       21You are in the four doored room.                                                                  21jar of delicious home made marmalade.                                                             22087512290        1                                                                                6223312331 229722973                                                                                62233222332228922893                                                                                63000010339        2                              WAKE UP IFF ASLEEP                                6AWAK?   22327?

A passage     leads off to the west, and the cave is           22illuminated by bright sunlight pouring in througha large hole in the south wall.                  22As if by magic, the crack grows until it is abouttwo feet across.                                 21East and north there is nothing but darkness.                                                     23You are in a small but comfortably furnished     room, the walls of which are lined from floor to 23ceiling with neat rows of leather bound volumes. The sole exception being the east wall which     23contains the only door, and a large portrait of  a genial looking old wizard.  The tomes which    23line the walls are very dusty, which makes one   wonder if any have been read for several years.  23The green leather chairs are in contrast         spotless, and the dark wooden tables placed here 22and there boast a shine that only daily polishingcould maintain.                                  21You are in the library.                                                                           23The most peculiar feature of the room must surelybe however the centre section of the north wall. 22At this point the bookcase has swung forward to  reveal a secret passageway.                      23As you try to withdraw the book, you realise thatit is actually a cunningly disguised lever.  As  23you pull it towards you, there is a loud grating noise as a whole section of the north wall book- 21case starts to move...                                                                            21There are no books on the east wall.                                                              23The volume you have chosen is written in a       strange and rare dialect of elvish, and is thus  21totally incomprehensible.                                                                         22You have chosen a French English phrase book -   not very entertaining I'm afraid.                21From which wall ?                                                                                 21Please answer north, south, east or west.                                                         23You appear to have arrived (via the wardrobe     door !) into someone's bedroom.  On closer       21examination of you surroundings, it appears that                                                  23You are in a ladies boudoir.  The occupant is    (unfortunately) not present, but discarded items 23of clothing scattered here and there tend to     indicate that she is in the habit of dressing in 23the manner of a byegone age (and in rather a     hurry !).  There are no windows, but the light   23from a small gas lamp reveals a small bed againstthe north wall, and a wardrobe against the west  21wall.  The main door is to the east.                                                              21You are now in the wardrobe.                                                                      23You are on the landing overlooking what looks    like a saloon bar plucked straight from the days 23of the wild west.  A flight of wooden steps leadsdown into the bar area where all manner of rough 23cowboy types are laughing, drinking and talking. The only other exit from the landing appears to  21be a small door to the west.                                                                      22Behind the bar there is a flight of wooden stairsleading up to the first floor landing.           21You are on the landing again.                                                                     23Suddenly the back wall of the wardrobe swings    open and the floor tips, ejecting you            21unceremoniously through the aperture.                                                             23You are in semi darkness.  The small amount of   light coming from an opening to the west reveals 22that to your north is a small wooden door in the rock face beside which is a life sized painting  21of an elf wielding an axe.                                                                        21of an elf.                                                                                        23For a moment, the elf and the axe take on an     almost lifelike quality.  You can hardly believe 23your eyes when the elf drops his axe on the floorwith a clang before once more becoming a mere    21painting.                                                                                         22You are in semi darkness.  You can just make out however a solid wall to the east.                23You are on a very narrow ledge on the east face  of an enormous rock wall.  The cold rock face    23is totally unclimable above you, but there seem  to be a few footholds here and there below.  The 23way down looks very long and perilous however,   and the bottom is out of sight, hidden by the    22cold mist that pervades the vast open chamber to the east.                                        23  The ledge itself continues unbroken northwards as far as the eye can see.  To the south, the    23ledge terminates abruptly at a small wooden door in the rock face that marks the southern end of  21the vast chamber.                                                                                 23As you emerge through the door,  the contrast is breathtaking.  A moment ago you were in a small  23warm but cramped room.  Suddenly now however,    the ceiling and right hand wall are no more, and 21the air is cold and crisp like a winter's night.                                                  23The ledge continues and the scenery remains much as before - rugged, vast and breathtaking.  A    23vast torrent of water is cascading down from     somewhere high up in the roof and thundering down23into the abyss below.  Over the eons, the spray  has etched a small alcove in the rock face to    23your west.  The ledge however must be of harder  rock because it continues both north and         23southwards as far as the eye can see.  The spray from the waterfall keeps the rock continually    22dampened making it slippery and thus unclimable  both above and below.                            23The ledge itself continues southwards as far as  the eye can see.  To the north however it        22vanishes through a low archway in the wall that  marks the northern end of this vast open chamber.22You are on a narrow ledge on the face of the     enormous cliff wall opposite a waterfall.        23In the small alcove, the noise of the waterfall  is slightly less deafening, but it is still very 21cold and damp, and the floor is wet.                                                              21nine foot long solid oak plank.                                                                   22seven foot long solid oak plank with one rather  chewed up end.                                   22You are at the south end of the narrow ledge on  the cliff wall.                                  22You are at the north end of the narrow ledge on  the cliff wall.                                  22243522435238523853                              INTO BOUDOIR                                      6238723871                        C0322436C0422437C0922437C1022436E                                 3239323981                        C0422435C0621173C0922435E                                         3239223921                        C032243510122438C1022435E                                         32235022350239923993                              FALL OUT OF WARDROBE                              61The door opens easily                                                                             21The door is not locked                                                                            2OPENDOOR12439UNLODOOR12440TRY HAND12439PUSHDOOR12439                                               72244322443241624163                              ONTO LEDGE                                        62409243212413            * KR2441C0122444C0222350C0622700C0922235E                                 3241924271                        C0122446C0222443C0422445C0922445E                                 3242824281                        C0322444C1022444E                                                 324092433124252425                C0122451C0222444C0622762C1022451E                                 33You are in a small dusty cave.
