3As you step out onto the stairway, it collapses  with a great crash, depositing you into the      21chamber below.                                   QUEST DATABASE  COPYRIGHT Keith Sheppard  1983   23You are at the head of a flight of very crumbly  stairs which look as if they could collapse      21completely any moment.                                                                            21You are at the head of the crumbly stairs.                                                        23You have arrived at the joining of three tunnels which stretch out to the south, east and west.   23The north wall is made of a crumbly yellow rock, and the floor is covered with yellow dust.  A    21strong smell of sulphur pervades the air.                                                         21You are at the joining of the three tunnels.                                                      23The eastern gallery turns out to be a dead end.  The sulphur is about half an inch thick on the   21floor here, and the smell is quite overpowering.                                                  23You are in an extremely narrow and not very high passage.

The remains of some cardboard boxes which 23apparently once contained some sort of biscuits  are piled up against the north wall, but rats    23have long since eaten the contents.  The rats    however were obviously still hungry, because they22also seem to have eaten a significant portion of the east wall.                                   21You are in the under floor store room.                                                            23You are in an extremely dirty and dark tunnel.   Every little now and then you catch sight of a   23pair of little pink eyes through the semi-gloom, before its owner scurries of squeeking loudly    23into the shadows.  The tunnel runs from east to  west, but there is a fair sized crack in the     21south wall.                                                                                       22You are in the tunnel of rats, and there is a    crack in the south wall.                         23Through this aperture you can just make out a    number of figures dressed in blue uniforms.      23They seem to have formed some sort of road block and are standing behind a large sign marked:%1   23 "official elvic police road block.%1              The elvic crown has been stolen - please%1     22  co-operate with police to secure arrest of%1     culprits."%1                                   23As you arrive at the road block, the police stop and search you.  On finding nothing of interest  21however, they let you pass.                                                                       23On arrival at the road block, the police stop youand search you.  There is a great deal of        23uproar when the elvic crown is found about your  person, and it is confiscated, and you are       21whisked off in a police car, sirens blaring.                                                      23You are in darkness again.  Only a faint green   glow from the east reveals that there is a door  22to the south.  There is also a rather unpleasant smell coming from a vaguely northerly direction. 22The door slams shut behind you, as if of its own volition.                                        23You are in a small box room.  There is a stout   wooden door to the north, and a dusty passage    21leading off to the east.                                                                          21You are in the box room.                                                                          23It is quite a long crawl.  On several occaions   it looks as if the passage is going to get too   23low or too narrow to permit further progress, butsomehow you manage to wriggle through.  Finally  21you emerge into somewhat less cramped conditions.                                                 23You are in a vast underground chamber.  The chasmis so tall, that clouds are visible high up above23you.  You seem to be in the south west corner of this chamber, but any progress north is          23impossible, because a torrent of water from      somewhere way up above you is thundering down    23to crash into a turbulent underground lake to    your north.  There is however a small opening in 22the west wall, and the wall itself looks as if   it may be climbable.                             22You are in the south east corner of the giant    chamber.                                         23You are in the south east corner of the vast     chamber.  Progress north is still impossible     22due to the enormous waterfall, and the east wall at which you have arrived is totally unscalable. 22You are in the south west corner of the vast     chamber.                                         23I wouldn't advise any attempt to progress north, you would surely perish under the thunderous     21might of that waterfall.                                                                          23You have arrived in a small room which seems to  have a choice of three exits.  The south wall    23contains a small archway through which a bright  green glow is shining.  The floor of this        23southern passage seems to be covered with molten metal, but strangely no heat can be felt.  To the23east, there is a ragged crack in the wall, whilstto the north, there is another passage leading   21off.                                                                                              23You are in the small room with exits of some     sort or another leading off to west, south and   21north.                                                                                            23The northern exit however is guarded by a most   fearsome brute.  A large two headed dog, both    22heads growling fiercely is standing in the       opening.                                         23The axe describes a graceful arc, and neatly     slices off both heads from the guardian of the   21north passage.                                                                                    22The two headed dog bars your way with an even    fiercer growl.                                   22The passage continues north a little way before  turning to the west.                             23You are on the east side of an eight foot round  pool of boiling oil.  The passage obviously      23continues the other side, but it is too far to   jump as there is not much of a ledge the other   21side.                                                                                             23As you step into the green glow, the elvic crown melts in your hand without so much as a single   21degree raised in temperature.                                                                     23You are in a small l-shaped room lit by a bright green glow from above.

To the south a      23giant waterfall is thundering from somewhere     high in the roof, down into the depths far below 23there seem to be no hand or foot holds above or  below you, so climbing in either direction is    23impossible.  The cavern is however narrower at   this point than any other, and a similar ledge   23on the west wall is only a tantalising twenty    feet or so away.  Just a little bit too far to   21jump with safety.                                                                                 22278222783        355                            INIT EAST GALLERY                                 625512                                                                                     22551    825511                                                                                     22551    82278510343        2                                                                                6276527651                * KR2787C0622551C0312786E                                                 31The crack is far too narrow to walk along.                                                        2CRAWEAST22788CRAW?   10343                                                                         72278922789276727673                                                                                6277127711                * KR2790C0622792C0412786E                                                 3CRAWWEST22791CRAW?   10343                                                                         72278522785276927693                                                                                6277327731                        C0422793C0522789E                                                 3277527751                JUMP    45522821C0322792C0762818E                                         327622                                                                                     91155    827621                                                                                     94155    83000022795        5                                                                                62279610339        2                                                                                6CARRCROW22797                                                                                      73Legend has it that the elvic crown was           donated by the wizard Idris, leader of the inner 23circle to elf king Dronwed, eighth of the Llewyd dynasty, in thanks to the king when the latter   23saved the wizard's fair daughter Brathnia from   the clutches of the zorks.  The crown was said   23to possess many magic qualities, and protect its wearer from all manner of evils.  Moreover when  23king Dronwed died in the 49th winter of the      rain era, it was reported that his soul had been 23transported to the crown, and that the crown was therefore possessed of its own free will and thus23has the power to resist any attempt to remove it from the inner sanctum.                          23 However,to encourage the spirit of the true     adventurer, the wizard Idris declared (apparently23with the late Dronwed's approval) that there     would be one path left to allow a true           23adventuring spirit to take the crown for his own,provided only that he look after it carefully and23agree to cherish the memory of good king Dronwed,defending that name against all insult           23for the rest of his life.                          The crown therefore has the power not only to  23hinder, but also to assist your departure from   this place.  In its presence, even once familiar 21places will be seen to have changed.                                                              21281422548        355                                                                              63As you try to step out onto the stairway, your   foot strikes an invisible force field which      23prevents further progress.

Just be careful that it isn't the iron in  22your blood next time. Perhaps you'd better returnit to its owner, if you can find him.            22The Philosophers' Stone bursts asunder in a cloudof golden dust which vanishes before your eyes...23An old and slightly embarassed-looking alchemist appears, wearing a long cloak covered with       23cabalistic symbols, a high pointed hat and a     pair of gold lame trousers. He speaks " Thank    23you for finding my precious stone. I must have   left it in the - er - library. As a token of my  23appreciation, I shall tell you of a magic word   which may save you in time of trouble. Don't     22use it more than once, though. The word is       BEZANTS".                                        22You are instantly surrounded by a wall of flame. When it subsides, your surroundings have changed:23You are instantly surrounded by a wall of flame  which consumes you completely, right down to your22socks! The last thing you hear is an ancient     voice intoning "...and BEZANTS to you, too..."   23Well, I did warn you. All the iron in your blood has turned to gold.

All round the walls are pots of       flowers of every hue and fragrance.  In the midst22of these flowers is a white wooden box, in the   shape somewhat reminiscent of an eastern pagoda. 21Please leave the flowers alone.                                                                   23Why did you take the lid off the beehive?????

RUN!!!                                                      21Try heading for water!!                                                                           22There's no point in getting wet unless you have  to.                                              23You have entered an almost featureless room. The walls and ceiling are a uniform grey and seem to 23be in some way insubstantial, like cobwebs. The  door through which you have entered is no longer 23visible: the only exit is a perfectly round hole in the floor. In the exact centre of the room is 22a marble pillar, about the height of a man...                                                     21The pillar is quite definitely immovable.                                                         22You slide down a steel tube and emerge, blinking,into the sunlight.                               23The room you have entered reminds you, in a      curious way, of a waxworks. All around the walls 23are fully inflated, inflatable women. Whoever    made these figures really knew his business :    23they are uncannily lifelike. Unfortunately, his  choice of model has lessened the erotic impact,  22somewhat. There, standing before you, are 100    clones of Margaret Thatcher!!!                   21My sentiments, entirely!!!!!                                                                      21Sorry to disappoint you, but it's only a doll!                                                    21box labelled "Kate Bush Doll (Self-inflating)".                                                   21Not here. Wait till you get home!                                                                 23As you enter the crowded station, the handle of  someone's umbrella catches on a ring on the      23outside of the "Inflatable Woman" box. (What do  you mean, you hadn't noticed?). With a           23deliciously flatulent noise, the model inflates  to its full size. Have you ever been in a        22crowded railway station with a naked woman under one arm ?  Well, you have, now!!                 21The valve appears to be jammed.                                                                   21What with?                                                                                        21Your way is blocked by a sea of jeering faces.                                                    23As you let go, the doll is caught by a freak gustof wind and sails off into the sky, never to be  21seen again. Oh well, better luck next time!                                                       22You are surrounded by a jeering crowd who are    making somewhat unsavoury allegations.           21.......1....................open box boolean                                                      21.......1...................putty getting boolean                                                  21.......1....................stone using boolean                                                   21.......1.....................BEZANTS boolean                                                      2?

The path runs from north to      south, and on either side, thick bands of        21delicate ferns sway gently in the warm breeze.                                                    23Unfortunately, the picturesque fronds are coveredwith hundreds and hundreds of microscopic        22stinging cells, and you stagger back with a      painful rash forming all over your arms and legs.23The ground underfoot is soft and rather marshy   here.  The surrounding bushes are covered with   23tiny droplets of water which glisten brightly in the fierce sunlight.  Here and there, large muddy23puddles have formed, and as you walk, your feet  make unpleasant squelching noises as the mud is  21forced up and over your shoes.                                                                    23You seem to have wandered into the marshes.  The heat is intense and the humidity oppressive.     23Visibility is down to about five yards because ofthe thick steamy mist that pervades the entire   23area.  The soft sticky mud which covers the      ground seems to vary in depth, but for the most  22part it seems to come up to your knees, making   progress slow and tiring.                        21The mud seems to get worse to the east.                                                           21The mud seems to get worse to the south.                                                          21The mud seems to get worse to the north.                                                          21You are wandering in the marshes.                                                                 23Suddenly the whole scene darkens and the heavens open.  You have been caught in one of those      23sudden tropical rainstorms.  In a matter of      seconds you are soaked to the skin, and with the 23pounding of the deluge on your head driving away all sense of reason, you run in blind panic (and 23in who knows what direction ? ) seeking shelter. At last you find it, and you sit, panting, in the23darkness and gathering your thoughts.  Then, justas suddenly as it started, the pounding of the   22rain stops and the sky lightens, enabling you to take stock of your surroundings.%1 %0            23You are in a small cave, illuminated by bright   sunlight pouring in through the entrance to the  23west.  Here and there on the floor there are     neat little piles of well picked and gnawed      23bones, and in one corner is a pile of large greenspeckled eggs.  Obviously there is something out 22there in the jungle that looks upon this cave as home ! %0                                        23As you gather up the bones, you are suddenly     interrupted by a nerve shattering roar.  You turn22to discover (to your horror) that the            owner/occupier of the cave has returned.         23The creature in question would be describable as slightly resembling a mouse were it not for the  23fact that it is about fifteen feet from the floorto the tips of its ears!  Behind it, twenty feet 23of hefty tail swish angrily back and forth.      Its mouth opens to reveal two parallel rows of   23sharp teeth lining each jaw, and the fearsome    growl that emerges tells you that                22it had considered the bones to be its supper,    but now it has other plans.....                  23The great jaws open once more, but what emerges  this time is not a roar, but a long snake like   23tongue which flicks out like a whiplash and      curles round you, dragging you screaming into    21that merciless mouth.                                                                             23The sharp teeth, each the size of a pickaxe, slamtogether, and after a brief moment of agony -    21blissful oblivion.                                                                                23With a loud gulp, the creature swallows you wholeand you slide unceremoniously down that chimney  22like oesophagus to land with a splash in the     waiting gastric juices.                          23Suddenly you are interrupted by a nerve          shattering roar.  you turn to find (to your      22horror) that the owner/occupier of the cave has  returned.                                        23You are floating in the caustic juices inside    the stomach of the giant creature.  The stinging 23feeling all over you body tells you that,        unless you get out of here fast, you too will    23soon be nothing more than one of those semi      digested and unrecognisable lumps of meat that   21can be seen bobbing about here and there.                                                         23Well - that seems to have had a rather startling effect.  The creature has started to retch, the  23gastric juices swelling like a stormy ocean with each convulsion.  A moment later, you are hurtled23out through that terrible mouth as the creature  is violently sick.  Obviously however, the       23creature has no intention of letting you get     away that easily, and it starts to lumber towards21you again menacingly.                                                                             23I'm afraid those gastric juices are starting to  get you.  Slowly you can fell your senses        21slipping....                                                                                      23You are at the edge of the jungle.  The ground   underfoot is soft and very wet, and seems to get 23worse to the west.  A thin band of open ground   runs from north to south, whilst to your east    22is a tall cliff in which the mouth of a small    cave is visible.                                 23For several minutes you flee in fear for your    life, neither noticing nor caring which direction22you go in.  Finally you stop and fall to the     floor, panting and exhausted.                    23As you pick up the first egg, it starts to crack open and, to your amazement, a mouse-like        21creature the size of an alsatian emerges.                                                         23Obviously these creatures are carnivorous from   birth, because with a mind blowing squeal, the   23baby launches itself at you, sinking its         double rows of knife like teeth deep into your   21flesh.                                                                                            22The baby gives a squeak of fear before running   out of the cave in fright.                       22The ground here is damp and marshy, and the      humidity oppressive.                             23You are at the edge of the jungle, on a narrow   strip of open ground running from north to south.21A vast cliff face rises to your east.                                                             23After a few feet, one of the scanty foot holds   collapses under your weight, and you are         21deposited on the ground amid a pile of debris.                                                    23I'm afraid you missed your footing and fell.  At the foot of the cliff, your head strikes a large 21rock, and it is all over.                                                                         22You are clinging by your toes and finger tips to a vast rock wall.                                22You seem to have reached a corner in the cliff   face which rises sheer to the north and east.    22You seem to have reached a corner in the cliff   face, which rises sheer to south and east.       22You seem to have reached a corner in the cliff   face, which rises sheer to south and west.       23You are at the edge of the jungle on a narrow    strip of open ground running from east to west.  21A vast cliff face rises to the north.                                                             23You are at the edge of the jungle on a narrow    strip of open ground running from east to west.  21A vast cliff face rises to the south.                                                             23You are at the edge of the jungle on a narrow    strip of open ground running from north to south.21A vast cliff face rises to the west.                                                              23You are at the edge of the jungle, on a narrow   strip of open ground that continues southwards.  23To the west there is a vast cliff face, through  a hole in which the wide and fast flowing river  21(which is to the north of you) vanishes.                                                          23You are wading up to your waist in a wide and    fast flowing river.  Here and there, log like    21objects can be seen floating in the warm waters.                                                  23You are at the northern edge of the jungle.      Progress westwards is blocked by a bank of giant 23ferns, and progress north by a vast cliff.  A    narrow strip of open ground runs alongside the   21cliff face to the east.                                                                           2318031801                * KR3218C0323184C0223187C0413096C0513161E                                 3316931691                        C0423384C0223188C0323185C0513161E                                 3316631661                        C0223189C0423184C0513161E                                         3309330931                * KR3218C0123664C0223368C0313096C0413096E                                 332143214132153215        * KR3218C0123384C0223192C0323188C0413096E                                 331583158131073107                C0123261C0223264C0323260C0423248E                                 3315931591                        C0123185C0223194C0423188C0523413E                                 3317531751                        C0323385C0223195C0523415$WA23050C0123598E                         3321632161                        C0223387C0323368C0423374$WA23050C0123598E                         331583158131063106                C0123248C0223258C0323264C0423263E                                 3310231091                        C0123265C0223266C0323268C0423267E                                 3314731471                        C0123260C0223259C0323201C0423264C0523413C0923201E                 3317331731                        C0123190C0223202C0323196C0523415E                                 3332733271                * KR3336C0123385C0223388C0323380C0423372C0523900E                         3334733471                * KR3350C0123368C0223382C0323198C0423387E                                 3335133511                * KR3359C0123192C0223383C0323199C0423380^WA23050E                         330983098131083108                C0123264C0223262C0323259C0423258E                                 3315931591                        C0123194C0223207C0423199C0523413E                                 3311631161                * KR3235C0423238C1023238E                                                 3317331731                        C0123195C0223208C0323203C0523415E                                 33442344213443        3510* KR2280C0123387C0223375C0323382C0423373E                                 3321432141                        C0123380C0223376C0323383C0423388E                                 3368036831                * KR3691C0123706C0223708C0323707C0423709E                                 33269326913271        3273* KR3290C0143199C0243378C0343379C0443383E                                 3315931591                        C0123200C0223213C0423206C0523413E                                 3316831681                        C0123202C0323209C0513161E                                         33171317113876        3877* KR3891C0143203C0343210C0443208C0543241E                                 331713171119641964                C0123204C0323211C0423209C0223360C0523241C0923360E                 3317131711                        C0123205C0323212C0423210C0523241E                                 331713171138883888                C0123206C0323213C0423211C0523241C0663889                *** 0001  3316731671                        C0123207C0423212C0513161E                                         31You are in the depths of a hot and steamy jungle.                                                 22To the west are large banks of exotic ferns,     swaying in the warm breeze.                      23You are in the jungle.

How do you open a      locked door (without damaging it) when you do'nt 21have the correct key ?                                                                            22You now find yourself in a little clearing in thejungle.                                          23In front of you there is a most curious machine. Shaped not unlike a motor cycle, with saddle and 23a dashboard (complete with several dials and a   large white lever) it is a most delicate and     23intricate apparatus.  There is ivory in it, and  some transparent crystalline substance.  It looks23to be singularly askew, and it contains several  bars, one of which has an odd twinkling          21appearance, making it seem somehow unreal.                                                        23You seem to reel, and get a nightmare sensation  of falling.  It passes quickly however, and when 23you recover, you look up to see that the clouds  are moving across the sky at terrific speed as   23if in some freak wind.  The path of the sun      across the heavens is also being executed at     23great speed which is constantly increasing, untilit becomes just a blurred streak.  Suddenly it   23is night - then just as suddenly, the following  day.  Night follows day follows night in an      23ever faster blur, until the flickering becomes   too fast to percieve.  All around you, trees are 23growing from seedlings to giant forests in the   twinkling of an eye, and most other motion       22proceeds too quickly for you to percieve, whilst the dials on the dashboard spin at great speed.  23You cling grimly to the saddle and watch in      amazement as you are flung headlong through time 21itself.                                                                                           23For a moment your head reels and you feel as if  you are falling, but the experience is           23transitory.  Looking up you see that the sun has begun to move across the heavens at noticeable   23speed travelling from west to east, and that it  is moving faster by the moment.  The dials in    23front of you are spinning round clockwise, and   moments later, it is night.  Then, just as       23suddenly, it is day again, then night, and so on in ever faster succession until they become a    23mere flickering before ceasing to be perceivable.All around you, vast forest shrink back into the 23ground, before new trees leap in an instant to   take their place.  All other motion in the       22outside world flashes past so quickly that you   can not see it.                                  23The machine seems to lurch violently, and you areflung headlong from it to land head over heels on22to the ground.  Still dazed, you stagger to your feet, and start to look around.                  23The machine is still there beside you, but the   jungle seems to have taken on a strangely        23prehistoric air.  A screech from above makes you look up.  High above you, a pair of pterodactyls 23can be seen circling in the sky.  Then a great   roar brings your eyes back to earth. %1          23  Approaching you from the nearby trees at great haste is a living specimen of tyranosaurus rex - 21saliva dripping from its great jaws.                                                              23You leap onto the saddle, but the monster is     still there - nearly upon you, its great jaws are21opening ready to devour you !                                                                     23Too late !  T. Rex is upon you.  You have time   only to think "Mark Bolan all is forgiven",      22before you become just another snack between     meals.                                           23You are seated comfortably on the saddle.  In    front of you are several dials, and a large white22lever which is unmarked, but looks as if it couldmove in either direction.                        21The lever is over as far as it will go.                                                           23Your journey through time continues - then       suddenly you realise (too late) that you have    22shot back to a time before the earth existed.    That of course means there is no atmosphere..... 23Your journey through time continues, but slowly  the flickering returns and you realise that the  23rotation of the earth is slowing down.           Eventually the sun comes to rest, just a few     23degrees above the horizon.  Then suddenly - the  ageing star swells to a super nova - the earth   22and you along with it are instantaneously        consumed in an explosion of cosmic proportions.  23You realise of course that dismounting from a    moving time machine is a bit like jumping down   23off an Inter-city 125 in full flight.  Your      molecules hit the waiting universe at a speed    22of about 42 years per hypersecond and are dashed to smithereens.                                  23You are on a soft, newly mown lawn, edged with   rhododendron bushes.  Two buildings are visible. 23To the east there is a huge building with        intricate parapets and tall columns, and a large 23open portal that yawns shodowy and mysterioius.  To the south is a veritable palace built         23apparently of green porcelain. %1                  You can also see, to the north and slightly    22west, a large white sphinx set upon a pedestal   the size of a house.                             23You are on the lawn roughly equidistant from the sphinx, the palace of green porcelain, and the   21large building with yawning portal.                                                               21Your time machine is standing right beside you.                                                   23Of your time machine however, there is no trace. Instead, there is a deep furrow running across   22the grass, and vanishing under the great bronze  doors in the plinth beneath the white sphinx.    22You have arrived just to the east of the great   white sphinx.                                    22In the pedestal are two great bronze doors,      firmly shut.                                     22The great bronze doors however are mysteriously  open, as if someone is almost inviting you in.   22I'm afraid that way would take you into the      rhododendrons.                                   23You are now in the palace of green porcelain.    It appears to be some sort of museum, full of    23all manner of machines and artifacts bearing     the signs of belonging to a byegone age.         23The central feature would appear to be a vast    machine, from which project a number of bars     23of apparently great weight and strength, not     unlike the levers one might have found in an old 21fashioned signal box.                                                                             23000010339        1                              FLIP STATE IF 1, ELSE DON'T UNDERSTAND            62178610339        1                              CAN ONLY MOUNT MACHINE IF IT IS THERE             63The lever moves slightly, and for a moment the   machine takes on a strange ghostly appearance -  21then suddenly it is gone.                                                                         21The machine is much too bulky to be lifted.                                                       21Please don't do that - that machine is unique.                                                    2?

The north seems brighter than   other directions, and it looks as if there may be22a small gap in the mountains just slightly east  of due north from your current vantage point.    23You now find yourself on a narrow strip of land  bordered by mountains to your west, and a river  23to the east and south.  To the north, the terrainseems to get more and more rugged and            21mountainous, and seems to ascend sllightly.                                                       21You are at the bend in the river again.                                                           23As you proceed north, the terrain seems to get   more and more rugged, and you seem to be climbing23all the time with small craggy hills on either   side.  When the scenery finally opens out, you   22realise you must have ascended several hundred   feet.                                            23The small plateau on which you now find yourself is bordered to the west by a deep ravine.  About 23two hundred feet below you in the bottom of the  ravine, is a fast flowing river with a narrow    23strip of vegetation on either side.  To the      north, the imposing face of the northern mountain22range seems very close now, and those to the     east are not very far off.                       21You are on the small plateau by the great gorge.                                                  23The steady climb seems long and arduous.  When   it finally levels out, you find that the scenery 22is now very different from that which you left   behind.                                          23You are on a small plateau, hemmed in on the westby vast mountains, and on the east by a deep     23gorge through which a great river can be seen    flowing from north to south way down about 200   21feet below you.                                                                                   23You have arrived at the eastern mountain range.  There is a tiny cave in the rock face, the       21entrance being only about two feet across.                                                        23The cave is no bigger than a small box room, but somehow much more claustrophobic.  You reflect   22that the sturdy rock walls on all sides must be  literally thousands of feet thick.               23You have arrived at the point where the northern and eastern mountains merge.  Imposing faces     21of sheer rock rise up on two sides.                                                               23You are on a small plateau.  To your west is a   deep gorge with river running far down below, and23to the north the imposing face of the mountains. The mountain face is broken however by a large   21cave entrance.                                                                                    23You are at the north west corner of a plateau.   To your east is a deep gorge with a fast flowing 23river running in its base, whilst to your north  a bleak and imposing mountain face is broken only23by a narrow archway leading into some            subterranean complex.

There is a great fissure   23running from east to west, right across the      centre of the chamber, and the whole area is lit 23by the dull red glow that emanates from it.  The air is warm and heavy with the smell of sulphur. 22There is an aperture apparently leading out into the open air in the south wall.                  23You are in the south east corner of the chamber. There is a small passageway running off to the   21east.                                                                                             22You are in the south west corner of the chamber. There is an opening in the south wall.           23The passage turns through 90 degrees here, and   continues westwards and northwards.  In the east 22wall there is a narrow crack about a foot across and about ten feet high.                         22You have reached another bend in the passageway. The tunnel proceeds to the west and south.       23This place was obviously once a cross roads.     The north and west passages have however both    23been blocked by an enormous land slide and are   plugged by a wall of boulders and rubble that    21looks as if it could be several feet thick.                                                       23You are at the end of a narrow passage which     enters this place from the north.  The west wall 22however is broken by a tall thin crack about a   foot across and running from floor to ceiling.   23You are on the southern edge of the fissure.     Looking down, the source of heat and light       23becomes obvious.  About thirty feet below you, anangry sea of molten lava is bubbling and boiling,22radiating heat and light up through the fissure  into the chamber above.                          23You are on the northern edge of the fissure.     Way down below you, inside the crack, the source 21of heat and light is                                                                              21You are in the north west corner of the chamber.                                                  23You are in the north east corner of a vast       vast underground chamber.  The chamber is bathed 23in an eerie flickering red glow emanating from   a great fissure, about ten feet across, which    23runs from the east wall right across to the west splitting the great chamber in two.

I have this day discovered a most       fascinating phenomenon.  There is a place        23somewhere along the edge of this cliff whereat   a natural fissure appears in the rock floor.     23This has the remarkable property that any item   dropped therethrough is transported by some      23mystic agency to my mountain base.  When this    mode of transport was tried on a mouse however,  23it brought about the poor creature's demise, and it arrived with all trace of life extinguished.  23I have unfortunately mislaid my notes of the     precise location of this phenomenon, I recall    23however its shape was not unlike that of a nag's mouth"%1                                         23   Then a sudden gust of wind catches the page   and sends it soaring aloft to be lost forever in 21the depths of the jungle.                                                                         22Set in the rock floor just here there is a small fissure in the shape of a horses mouth.          23Your body and chattels are mysteriously          transported back to the log cabin.
